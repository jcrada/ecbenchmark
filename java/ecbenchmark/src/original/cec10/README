IEEE CEC benchmark functions:
In IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation, every now and then, benchmark 
functions are created to evaluate the performance of evolutionary algorithms. 
The source code of the CEC'2010 benchmark functions is available for free at 
[http://nical.ustc.edu.cn/cec10ss.php]*. However, I found it too difficult to 
understand their code, so I decided to re-engineer them in order to provide more
 readability regardless of the efficiency. Accidentally, my implementation 
appears to be slightly more efficient  (based on a few results from the NetBeans 
Java Profiler).

The code in this folder and subfolder comes from:

*K. Tang, Xiaodong Li, P. N. Suganthan, Z. Yang and T. Weise, 
"Benchmark Functions for the CEC'2010 Special Session and Competition on 
Large Scale Global Optimization," Technical Report, Nature Inspired Computation 
and Applications Laboratory, USTC, China, http://nical.ustc.edu.cn/cec10ss.php

CHANGELOG:
    * Added "package original.cec10;" at the beginning of each file.
    * Added public visibility to class Kernel.java (had package visibility).
    * Added public visibility to methods with package visibility in Kernel.java.
    * Added public visibility to Defaults class and static variables (had package visibility).
    * Removed "final" from property Defaults.DEFAULT_DIM.
    * Function.java implements ecbenchmark.core.Function.
    * Renamed method "compute" from Function.java (and all descendants) to "f" in 
        order to satisfy the implementation of ecbenchmark.core.Function.
